# Wedding Project Development Rules

## Check MEMO folder for project status and tasks
Before implementing any changes or new features, always check `MEMO/wedding_extension_tasks.md` for:
- Current implementation status of features
- Task priorities and what needs to be completed
- Database changes required for deployment
- Development workflow guidelines

@MEMO/wedding_extension_tasks.md

## Branching Strategy
- All new features should be developed in feature branches
- Format: `feature/{feature-name}`
- Check current branches and their status before creating new ones
- After testing, create a PR to merge into main 

## Date Handling
- Always use the current date (2025年4月16日) for documentation and commit messages
- Do not rely on system time for date references
- When adding dates to the Git commit log (memo/git記録), ensure the date is accurate
- Double-check dates before committing changes to version control
